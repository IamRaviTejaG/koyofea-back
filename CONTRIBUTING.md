# Contributing to Koyofea

Please follow the guidelines below to make sure that your contribution makes its way into our master branch.

### Code Contributions
- **Always** stick to the [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/rules.html) style guide.
- **Always** follow the `50/72` rule for Git commit messages. Refer [this](http://api.coala.io/en/latest/Developers/Writing_Good_Commits.html) guide for further reading on this.
- **Always** create a new branch using `git checkout -b <branch-name>` while working on an issue. Ensure that you keep your master branch clean.
- **Always** run `npm test` and make sure all the tests pass before opening a pull request.

### Pull Requests
- **Always** target your pull request to the `master` branch.
- **Always** keep the relevant discussion on the pull request page and not on the issue. In short, never abandon your pull request.
- **Never** leave your pull request description empty.
- **Do** [reference associated issues](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests) in your pull request description. This helps in keeping track of things easily.
